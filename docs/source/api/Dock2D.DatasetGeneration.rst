DatasetGeneration/
==================

Generate a protein pool to create IP and FI datasets.

Protein Pool:

The protein pool is generated by creating protein shapes using input parameter distributions for
`alpha` (the concavity of the shapes) and `num_points` (the number of points used in shape hull generation).

Protein:

Generate either convex or concave hull based on specifying `alpha` and `num_points`.
Hulls are created by radially distributing random points, then optimizing a perimeter based on the specified `alpha`.
Shapes can be convex by setting relatively lower `alpha` and higher `num_points`.
Hulls coordinates are then converted to grid based shapes,
where pixels within the hull perimeter are assigned a value of 1, and 0 otherwise.
