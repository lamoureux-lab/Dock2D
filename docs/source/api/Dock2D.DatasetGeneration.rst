DatasetGeneration/
==================

**Generate a protein pool to create IP and FI datasets.**

**Protein:**

Generate either convex or concave hull based on specifying `alpha` and `num_points`.
Hulls are created by radially distributing random points, then optimizing a perimeter based on the specified `alpha`.
Shapes can be convex by setting relatively lower `alpha` and higher `num_points`.
Hulls coordinates are then converted to grid based shapes,
where pixels within the hull perimeter are assigned a value of 1, and 0 otherwise.

**Protein Pool:**

The protein pool is generated by creating protein shapes using input parameter distributions for
`alpha` (the concavity of the shapes) and `num_points` (the number of points used in shape hull generation).
This file is saved as `.pkl` and loaded in `DatasetGenerator` to compute interactions.

**DatasetGenerator:**

Load/create shapes from the protein pool and compute interactions for IP (docking pose prediction) and FI (fact-of-interaction) datasets.
Interactions that score below specified decision thresholds are added to their respective dataset. Dataset generation
figures and statistics can be generated and saved to file.
