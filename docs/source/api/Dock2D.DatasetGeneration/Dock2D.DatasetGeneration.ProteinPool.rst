ProteinPool
===========

The protein pool is generated by creating protein shapes using input parameter distributions for
`alpha` (the concavity of the shapes) and `num_points` (the number of points used in shape hull generation).
This file is saved as `.pkl` and loaded in `DatasetGenerator` to compute interactions.
